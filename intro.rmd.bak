#Introduction
Hello welcome to our introduction CTF. This CTF is to give you an idea of how does ethical hacking works within a CTF environment. If you don't know what a CTF, a CTF is basically a execrise/game in which "flag" are hidden within purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. A CTF flag would look something "CTF{g3t_g00d_n00b2}" and would be hidden within a root/admin folder. There are multiple types of CTFs such as: Foresnic CTFs (which utilities digital foresnics), Web CTFs where the attacker attacks a web server (which is what we will be covering today), Reverse Engineering (which involve exploiting a program binary), etc. 

The platform that this CTF will be hosted is TryHackMe but they are many other websites such as HacktheBox, PicoCTF, etc.
